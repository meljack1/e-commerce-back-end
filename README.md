## Description
An e-commerce back-end using an Express.js server and using Sequelize to connect with a MySQL database. It was my first time using Sequelize to interact with MySQL, so I learned a lot from building this back-end.

## Installation
Navigate to ```./e-commerce-back-end```

Run the following command from the terminal: 

```npm i```

## Usage
1. Ensure MySQL is installed and set up on your computer before using this application. A guide can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)

2. Navigate to ```./e-commerce-back-end```

3. Initialise the database by running the following commands in the terminal: 
```mysql -u root -p```
```source db/schema.sql```

4. Open a new terminal and run the following commands:
```npm run seed```
```npm start```
